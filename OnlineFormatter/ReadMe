Online Formatter project has different tools to format/structure data like HTML, SQL, JSON formatters.

Also, it has a facility to identify unique error log information by uploading the .log or .txt files. 

This project is implemented by CoreJava, JSP, Servlets. There is no database required.

Few of the Jar's I am not able to download through mvnrepository. All libraries which I have used, you can find in web-inf/lib diretory.

Note: There is some improvement needed, if anyone interested please let me know.
